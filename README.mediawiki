This ZenPack introduces a new widget framework for creating portlets and sharing dashboards. Users may define any number of portlets and dashboards, which may be shared globally or with specific groups.

== Sharing Dashboards  ==
By default, a dashboard has three levels of visibility:
# Owner
# Group
# Global
These levels allow a dashboard to remain private during development, and
then published to a wider audience upon completion. This ZenPack adds the dashboard relationship to the following objects:
# UserSettings - private dashboards
# GroupSettings - group dashboards
# UserSettingsManager - global dashboards


Changing the visibility of a dashboard object moves it from one relationship to another.
For example, the primary path of a private dashboard named "Test" is "/zport/dmd/ZenUsers/<USERID>/dashboards/Test".
Promoting the dashboard to global changes the primary path to "/zport/dmd/ZenUsers/dashboards/Test".


'''Note''': Dashboard names must be unique in each relationship context.
You can not promote a private dashboard named "Test" to global if
a global dashboard named "Test" already exists.

== Portlets ==
The following, default portlets are defined by this ZenPack:
* Site Window - Displays an iframe on the dashboard
* Device Chart (5.x only) - Displays a chart with devices from a specific device class and graph point
* Device Issues - Shows devices which currently have events
* Production State - Shows which devices are in specified production states
* Network Map - D3-forced layout view of the network map
* Open Events Chart - Shows open events grouped by severity
* Google Maps - Enables selecting a location, at which the event severities at that location are displayed
* And more...

== Permissions ==
* There are no owner-level permissions associated with dashboard objects. Any user may edit a dashboard if they have "Change Device" permission.
* Users with "Add DMD Objects" permission may add a dashboard.
* User with "Delete Objects" permission may remove a dashboard.
* Permissions are checked both on the client and server.
* If the Audit ZenPack is installed, all operations on dashboards are audited.

The "Add DMD Objects" and "Delete Objects" permissions are are global roles; the context of dashboard objects can not have permissions applied to them.

== Writing a new Portlet ==

Portlets are written in Javascript using ExtJS. A portlet consist of one ExtJs class that descends from "Zenoss.Dashboard.view.Portlet". The following example shows a portlet definition.

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
    /**
     * A simple portlet that lets users define custom HTML to be displayed
     * on the application dashboard. This will execute any javascript that is
     * written.
     **/
    //1. The portlet must be in the Zenoss.Dashboard.portlets namespace, in which everything is assumed to be a portlet.
    Ext.define('Zenoss.Dashboard.portlets.HTMLPortlet', {
        extend: 'Zenoss.Dashboard.view.Portlet',
        //2. An alias (required) is used to instantiate the portlet when the dashboard is rendered
        alias: 'widget.htmlportlet',
        height: 100,
        //3. The default title displays on the dropdown of available Portlets
        title: 'HTML Portlet',

        //4. All default config properties of portlets should be defined on the class
        content: "<h1>Blank HTMLPortlet</h1>",
        initComponent: function(){

            Ext.apply(this, {
                html: this.content
            });

            this.callParent(arguments);
        },
        //5. getConfig is called when serializing portlets. It returns the options that are saved on the portlet.
        //   height and refresh rate are included from the parent class
        getConfig: function() {
            return {
                html: this.content
            };
        },
        //6. applyConfig is where you apply the configuration to the portlet. This can include updating stores and content.
        applyConfig: function(config) {
            if (config.html && config.html != this.content) {
                this.content = config.html;
                this.update(config.html, true);
            }
            this.callParent([config]);
        },
        //7. Template method for what happens when a portlet refresh is requested.
        onRefresh: function() {

        },
        //8. Any custom configuration fields for your portlet are defined here. The caller expects an array in return.
        getCustomConfigFields: function() {
            var fields = [{
                xtype: 'textarea',
                fieldLabel: _t('Content'),
                name: 'html',
                value: this.content,
                allowBlank: false,
                height: 100,
                width: 200
            }];
            return fields;
        }
    });
</syntaxhighlight>
